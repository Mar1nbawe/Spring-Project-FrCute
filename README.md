This is a project. In Java.

If I had a nickel for everytime Visual Studio Code broke Maven, I'd have two and it's weird it happened in two different languages.

All jokes aside, this is an MVP for a store which sells fruits and vegetables, the name is a typo and I decided it's cool enough to keep it.
